## Usage and Installations
Refers to Manim Community [documentation page](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/guides/configuration.html).

The general cli command for rendering the scripts with Manim is as follows:

![manim-illustration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ManimCommunity/manim/main/docs/source/_static/command.png)

The `-p` flag in the command above is for previewing, meaning the video file will automatically open when it is done rendering. The `-ql` flag is for a faster rendering at a lower quality.

Some other useful flags include:

-  `-s` to skip to the end and just show the final frame.
-  `-n <number>` to skip ahead to the `n`'th animation of a scene.
-  `-f` show the file in the file browser.
